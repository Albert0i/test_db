### Prologue
Coincidence! There is no such thing as coincidence and I don't think it ever exists in real life... Everything happens according to a devised plan, I mean HIS plan. Have you ever think of an old friend and later on you encounter him/her. Missing a bus but that recalls you that there's no tea at home, your shrew wife definitely grows furious if you ever forgot it. 

Next time when something hits on you unexpectedly, it is HE who gives you a chance to console or compensate. Help or be helped is much the same thing. 


### I. Introduction
If you opt to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) related technique and [Relational database](https://www.oracle.com/in/database/what-is-a-relational-database/), [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) seems an obviously choice, if it were not the only choice... 

But [ORM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/) may not be good for: 
1. Loose database schema 
2. Fast schema evolving 
3. System with complex query 
4. Flexible table joining 

In case of 1 and 2, I recommend [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), which is a mature [ODM](https://www.dctacademy.com/blog/what-is-object-document-mapper-odm) solely for MongoDB. 

In case of 3 and 4, I recommend not to use ODM at all. Use [MySQL 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg), [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb), [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) and [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) packages respectively. 

If you think there exists a tool fits for everything, I will give you a lollipop.
